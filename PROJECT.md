# ✨ Project Gideon – Discord Assistant Bot

Welcome to **Project Gideon**, your hands-on AI assistant for your Discord community!

## 🤖 What Does the Bot Do?

- **Always Ready:** The assistant lives in your chosen Discord text-channel (configurable via `.env`).
- **Q&A Power:** Whenever a message in the channel includes `@<BOT_USERNAME>`, the assistant responds using ChatGPT. Ask any question about what Gideon can do now, or what’s coming soon—it knows the roadmap and all current features!
- **Smart Scheduling:** If you ask the assistant to schedule an event or meeting in plain English, it will automatically create a Discord event in the server. Example:

  > “Hey @assistant, can you schedule a meeting with Faizan and Faseeh to discuss the new WERKR project tonight at 8pm CEST?”

  The bot will then create the event and notify the relevant people!

## ⚡️ Getting Started

1. **Configure the Assistant:**
   - Set the desired text-channel ID in your `.env` file.
   - Invite the bot to your Discord server and give it the required event and message permissions.

2. **Mention the Bot:**
   - In the configured channel, mention `@<BOT_USERNAME>` with your question.
   - For event scheduling, describe your event details in your message.

## 💡 What Can I Ask?

- "What can you do?"
- "How do I schedule a meeting?"
- "Can you tell me about future features?"
- "Schedule a team sync on Friday at 4 pm!"

If it’s a question about Project Gideon or you need the bot to plan something, just ask—and it handles the rest, right inside Discord!

For now, Project Gideon is focused on this hands-on assistant experience and event scheduling. More dev-focused features are coming soon—stay tuned!
