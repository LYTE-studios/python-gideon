## 🚀 Using Gideon in Practice

- **Get Instant Answers:** Mention `@<BOT_USERNAME>` in the configured channel to ask the assistant anything: about current features, future roadmap, or usage tips.
- **Schedule Discord Events:** Ask in plain English for a meeting or event, and if the request is clear (“@assistant, schedule a planning call tomorrow at 10am with Faizan and Faseeh”), the bot creates a Discord event and notifies participants.

## 💡 Example Interactions

- “@assistant What can you do right now?”
- “Hey @assistant, schedule a demo with Ana on Friday at 2 pm!”
- “@assistant What features are coming next?”
